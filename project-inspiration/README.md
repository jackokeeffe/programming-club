## Project Inspiration

### Vote:
- April Break
	- GUI's (Calculator, *E-mails*)
	- API's (Weather, Stock Market, *Movies*)
	- External Libraries (Pandas, Selenium, Beautiful Soup)

### Notes:
- Make an original project.
- You can find the idea online, but you should write the code.
- You do not have to only write in Python, but it is recommended.

### Look for a Substring (Easy):
- Let the user input a string, and then another string.
- The program could check the original string and see if it contains the second string.
- Example: "Superman" contains "man".

### Solve a Math Problem (Medium):
- Each tile is 3cm x 3cm and costs $0.14.
- How much to $$$ to cover a 120cm x 120cm area.

### Extra Ideas:
*Difficulty Ranked Against Past Club Projects*
- Add onto  a Club Project (Easy - Hard)
- Reminder App (Save/Read to .txt file) (Medium)
- Maybe try implementing API's (Medium)
- Send someone an e-mail (Medium - Hard)
- Web Scraper (Hard)
- Calculator with GUI (Hard)
