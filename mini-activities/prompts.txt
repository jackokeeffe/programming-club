Coding Prompts:

FizzBuzz (T):
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz”
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers that are multiples of both
three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

All Equal (B):
Define a function named all_equal that takes a list and checks whether all elements in the list are the same.
- For example, calling all_equal([1, 1, 1]) should return/print True.
s
Anagram (E):
Write a function that takes two words (input or argument) and returns/prints true if they are
anagrams (contain the exact same letters) and false otherwise.
- For example, anagram('word', 'drow') would return/print true.

#Length (C):
Create a function that takes a number num and returns/prints its length.
- The use of the len() function is prohibited.
