### Replit
To run your program:
Click on the shell tab (to the right)
Type ```python files/yourname.py``` and click ```enter```.

### Algorithms
Choose a challenge and try to create a solution either on your own or with a partner.

** 1. Linear Search ([Solution](https://replit.com/@jackokeeffe/search-algorithms-Preview#linearSearch.py))**
- Searches every value of the list.
- Checks if the guess is the same as the current element within the list.
- "We know that linear search on an array of n elements might have to make as many as n guesses." - Khan Academy

** 2. Binary Search ([Solution](https://replit.com/@jackokeeffe/search-algorithms-Preview#binarySearch.py))**
- Checks halfway through the list to see if the value matches.
- If the element checked is > the number we are guessing, ignore the any value higher than the element.
- If the element checked is < the number we are guessing, ignore the any value lower than the element.
- Try again with these restricitons and repeat until the number is guessed.
