### Challenges
**1. Is this Password Common? ([Solution](https://replit.com/@jackokeeffe/Programming-Club-2021-4#stepOne.py))**
- Let the user enter a password, check to see if that password is [commonly used](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/uk/most-common-passwords-scli-gbr-intl).

```commonPasswords = ["password", "123456", "qwerty"]```

**2. Traditional Password Checker ([Solution](https://replit.com/@jackokeeffe/Programming-Club-2021-4#stepTwo.py))**
- Check if the password entered is over [12 characters](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/password-tips-experts/).
- Check to see if the password contains any symbols.

**3. Combine #1 & 2 ([Solution](https://replit.com/@jackokeeffe/Programming-Club-2021-4#stepThree.py))**
- Only do this if you have completed #2.
- Show me your program (from #2) first!
