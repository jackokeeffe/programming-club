## Programming Club 2021 (v2): #1
Split into two sides (beginners & experienced).

### Structure
0. Quick introduction to a new topic/library (and an example) (~15 min).
1. Try to solve a challenge using new skills (~10-20 min).
2. Share your projects (~5-10 min).

### What is Python?
Python is a programming languages that "emphasizes code readability".

#### Python:
```
print("Hello World!")
```

#### C++ ([Source](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/examples/print-sentence))
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

### Replit
An online IDE (like Google Docs for code). Each week I will share a new file with you.

Python, pip, and other resources do not need to be installed (by you)

To run your program:
Click on the shell tab (to the right)
Type ```python attempts/yourname.py``` and click ```enter```.

### Challenges
[Hangman](https://www.hangmanwords.com/play/custom?g=YXBwbGUlMEFwZWFyJTBBZ3JhcGUlMEFwaW5lYXBwbGUlMEFiYW5hbmElMEFibHVlYmVycnk=): Try to create a simple hangman project:
- User should be told a hint and the # of letters
- User should be able to input a guess (variable or input())
- The program should check/compare the word and tell the user if they guessed correctly

Extra:
- (+) Give the user multiple tries, after each try let the user know how many tries they have left. After all the tries are gone, stop the program.
- (++) Have multiple words and randomly select one for the user to guess.

### Resources
[Github](https://github.com/jackokeeffe/programming-club): Where all the code answers/solutions will be stored.
