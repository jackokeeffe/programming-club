## Programming Club (2021): #7

### Replit
To run your program:
Click on the shell tab (to the right)
Type ```python files/yourname.py``` and click ```enter```.

### Challenges (w/ errors)
Try to find all the errors in the code!

**Fix the Program: ([Answer](https://replit.com/@jackokeeffe/Programming-Club-2021-7#answer.py))**
-  Make a copy of [challenge.py](https://replit.com/@jackokeeffe/Programming-Club-2021-7#challenge.py)
- Try to find all 7 errors in the program without running the program
- Fix the program so it completes the original task

**Create and Share a Program**
- Create your own example of a program with error's.
- The goal of this program can be anything we have done, just make sure there are at least 5 errors (keep track of the errors to help your partner).
- After the time is up, swap your program with the person beside you and try to fix all the errors (in a seperate document).

**Hint:** If a line in your program has a red line under it, when you are finished rename your file to filename.txt

Changing your file to .txt changes it from a python file to a text file, making it impossible to run.

### Steps to Convert to .txt File:

1. Write your code in a .py file
2. Change the .py file extension to .txt
3. Make syntactical errors
4. Make a new .txt file
5. Copy your text (code) from the old .txt to the new. txt
