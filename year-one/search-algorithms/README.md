### **Linear Search:**

n = number of items

Maximum Number of Guesses = n

Example:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

n = 10

It would take at maximum 10 guesses.

### **Binary Search:**

n = number of items

Maximum Number of Guesses = log2(n)

Example:

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

n = 10

log2(10) = 3.32192809489

Round Down = 3

Guess 1: 10/2 = 5

Guess 2: 5/2 = 2.5 (2)

Guess 3: 2/2 = 1
